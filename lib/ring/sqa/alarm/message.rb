"Regarding: #{Ring::SQA::CFG.host.name} #{Ring::SQA::CFG.afi}

This is an automated alert from the distributed partial outage
monitoring system 'RING SQA'.

At #{Time.now.utc} the following measurements were analysed
as indicating that there is a high probability your NLNOG RING node cannot
reach the entire internet. This could be down to your RING node, its local
network, or disruption of peering and/or upstream networks (for example
instability at an IXP or one of your transit providers).

The following #{amount} nodes previously were reachable, but became unreachable
over the course of the last 3 minutes:

#{nodes_list}

As a debug starting point 3 traceroutes were launched right after
detecting the event, they might assist in pinpointing what broke:

#{mtr_list}

An alarm is raised under the following conditions: every 30 seconds
your node pings all other nodes. The amount of nodes that cannot be
reached is stored in a circular buffer, with each element representing
a minute of measurements. In the event that the last three minutes are
#{Ring::SQA::CFG.analyzer.tolerance} above the median of the previous #{Ring::SQA::CFG.analyzer.median_of} measurement slots, a partial
outage is assumed. The ring buffer's output is as following:

#{buffer_list}

Kind regards,

NLNOG RING
